# Welcome to Habbity!

Habbity is designed to be exactly what anybody really needs - a repeating todo-list that encourages you to make a ~~habbity~~ habit of doing some things every day. It takes 28 days to make a habit - bit by *bity* - and that's what we're here to do!

We're not here to punish you if you miss a day or two - we know life happens, and learning new things is hard. We just want to be here to help you on your mission of being a little better than you were before, every day.

**No micro-transactions, no FOMO, no whacking you with sticks if you lose your 187-day streak or sending the green Habbity rabbit to your house because you missed your Spanish lesson. You're in charge - we're just supporting you being who *you* want to be.**

Sure, you could try other habit-tracking services, like **[REDACTED]**, **[REDACTED]** or **[EXTRA-REDACTED]**.

But *we* didn't make those, so they're not quite good enough.

## Why should I use Habbity?

Habbity is a habit-tracking app. Simple, unobtrusive.

For something to be a habit, it's not enough to do it 'somewhat often' - you have to do it every day. Forge the connections in your brain and reinforce that muscle memory - nothing starts easy, but with habits, you can make them just another mundane part of your day. You can start to appreciate the great results of good habits!

> *eg: going for a 40min run every morning sounds awful, but people who are used to going on 40min runs love how easy it is to breath, how they don't feel tired all the time, how energised they feel for the rest of the day.*

Bad habits you want to stop seem like good ideas for your Habbity, but you set yourself up for failure if you only tell yourself you want to *stop* something, especially cold turkey - you create a space in your life looking for something similar to fill it. You'll see the best success if you decide something good you want to do instead, and focus on that - otherwise you'll replace one bad habit with another!

> *eg: want to quit eating so much sugar? Don't measure your success based on having no sugar at all - make a habit of preparing a filling nutritious lunch every day, instead. You'll end up eating less sugar as a result, because you won't feel as hungry. This leads to more natural, sustainable change. And your energy will get better, too!*

Remember - a habit is about sustainability. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Start your habits small - don't take on too many at once, and don't make any of your habits too big. The best way to motivate yourself for big successes to succeed at the small ones, first!

> *eg: not a runner? Don't jump straight to the 40min jog - start with making a habit of walking around the block in the morning (maybe without headphones, so you can hear the morning birdsong?). It's simple, relaxing, non-strenuous, and shouldn't cause too much discomfort - it's just about getting out there. Once that's a habit, you can swap it up to a jog or start walking further!*

## How should I use Habbity?

1.  **Let us get to know you.** We need you to log in before we can start ~~keeping tabs on you~~ saving your habits.
1.  **Tell us what you want your new daily habit to be.** We'll track how often you've done it, when you've ticked it, etc.
1.  **Check back every day to let us know when you've done it.** Not only will our list remind you of what you want to do, we'll be counting how much you've done it.
1.  **It takes 28 days to make a habit....** If you start skipping days (even for *totally legit* reasons), it's not really a habit! You have to do it every day.

    - **...It's official!** Once your habit has been done successfully every day for 28 days, we'll consider that done! It's up to you to maintain it, we're not going to nag you - but you can reactivate it if you ever want to start tracking it again.
      > *Never feel ashamed of giving in - only of giving up.*
    - **...It's a flop!** Brains are fickle! If you miss a day, you might feel disappointed, but don't feel guilty - being here already shows a desire to change. You haven't failed! Brains are like rubber-bands. Don't break yourself by stretching too far at once - it'll hurt whenever you snap back. Just focus on *stre-e-etching* bit by bit. Maybe your habit was too big, or real life called you away. It's all okay, there's no shame - failed habits can be reactivated whenever you're ready to give them another go.

### Kia kaha, everybody - your future awaits, and we're excited to watch you build it.
